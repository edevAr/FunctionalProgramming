# WORD-COUNT functional programming example
Below I have described the steps to run the application binary:
1. Download the code, you can download through two ways:
* git clone https://github.com/edevAr/FunctionalProgramming.git
* you can press the button Clone or Download -> Download zip
2. Once you have downloaded the app you can execute the source code in your IDE(Preferably intellij IDEA) or you can execute de 
binary file(WordCount-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar), this file should be inside your folder where you have downloade the code using the command that you can see below:
* java -jar WordCount-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /PATH/of/your/file.txt(this file should contain some text)
* Be aware, the file path should be correct, if you introduce a wrong path the program will throw a message indicating that the "file path is incorrect or it doesn't exist".
